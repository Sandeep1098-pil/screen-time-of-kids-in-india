📊 Project Title: Screen Time Analysis Among Indian Kids
🔍 Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing screen time behavior among Indian children by age, gender, and device usage. The goal is to uncover patterns, quantify health impacts, and explore educational versus recreational screen usage.

📁 Tools & Technologies:
Google Colab: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing using Python
Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Power BI: For interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations

🔧 Key Steps in the Project:
Data Cleaning:
 Handled missing values using mode imputation, removed duplicates, and normalized screen time.

Feature Engineering:
Converted screen time from hours to minutes
Encoded gender and other categorical variables
Created binary columns for classification (e.g., exceeded screen time limit)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Age vs screen time
Gender-wise health issues
Urban vs rural device usage

Visualizations in Power BI:
Stacked bar charts comparing health impacts by gender
Device usage distribution by age
Screen time trends across different regions

📈 Key Insights:
 47.32% of kids primarily use smartphones
 Age group 12–17 spends 4.5+ hours on screens daily
 Over 55% of children who exceed screen time limits report poor sleep quality
 Recreational screen use outweighs educational usage in most cases
